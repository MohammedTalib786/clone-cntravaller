			<p>For Brooklyn-based Bengali American writer and director Shayok Misha Chowdhury, theatre is home. It is only fitting that his story, which explores queer intimacy and societal grooves through an inter-cultural lens, debuts off-Broadway on 15 February. Public Obscenities, presented by Soho Rep and the NAATCO National Partnership Project, follows Choton, a Bengali American PhD student, and Raheem, his Black American cinematographer boyfriend, on an extended visit to Choton’s family home in Kolkata. Their purpose of the visit is to interview locals they meet through queer hookup apps, as part of Choton’s research. As Choton juggles Bangla and English, Grindr and academese, Rahim finds a roll of undeveloped film in Choton’s grandfather’s old camera. What follows is a telling tale across generations and even through death.
			</p><br>
			
			<strong>Why did you decide to make the play a bilingual production? Was it always the idea?</strong><br><br>

			<p>The fact that it is a bilingual production in Bangla and English, being staged in an American metropolitan, is what the play is about. I think I know more queer Bengalis than Bengalis who have lived in the States and managed to retain their fluency in Bangla or their relationship with their home country. I have always inhabited this in-between space from where I wanted to write the script, and I wanted to write a play that took place in our house, in Kolkata. It is sort of an homage to the only place that has been my home through generations. The place, the house, is the first protagonist of the play. Creating the experience of Choton bringing their Black American boyfriend to Kolkata, required this linguistic nimbleness that the play ends up leaning into.</p>

			<strong>How did you come up with the name Public Obscenities?</strong><br><br><br>

			<p>There is a poem that I wrote a long time back, in Kolkata, with the same title. I was there for about a year. During my stay, I would spend a lot of time at Rabindra Sarobar, by the lake. This was before the era of dating apps, and the place was a popular queer cruising spot. I quickly realised that were a lot of queer people who existed in Kolkata. For once, my Bangaliness and my queerness were not at war with each other. They were not separate. There is a long line of queer history here…I mean in Kolkata. With the moshari [mosquito net] and snippets of Bangla floating around, I feel like I am back home (giggles). My time at the lake also made me realise that queerness was still a hidden and obscene concept. The title also draws from article 292 of the Indian Penal code and what constitutes obscenity. I was fascinated by what is considered taboo and what is declared erotic. The entire play takes place in this flat in South Kolkata. The porosity of what is private and what is public, who’s going to walk in on you and who is watching you, is at the heart of the play. Hence, the name.</p><br>

			<p>I am always in a constant process of being proven wrong (laughs). I always thought it would be impossible to cast this play.</p><br>

			<strong>Speaking of the moshari, which I know is an integral part of the script, did you want to introduce these cultural signifiers to the regular American audience intentionally?</strong><br><br>

			<p>The moshari is there because it can not but be there, just like the other objects and experiences. In some ways, Choton is constantly in a process of explaining and translating for Raheem and the non-Bangali audience enters the play through Raheem’s experience. An experience that is only possible when they travel halfway across the world and try to understand who they are. I think the Bangali and the non-Bangali audience will have two radically different experiences of the play. If we were to stage this play in Kolkata, there would be many aspects of Choton and Raheem’s relationship that would seem equally foreign and unfamiliar to those audience members. I don’t think anyone, other than perhaps you and I…and a handful of people would have all of the fluencies required to decode the play. That very friction between the fluencies is what excites me.</p><br>

			<strong>The casting–with trans activist Tashnuva Anan and Namesake’s Gargi Mukherjee–is exciting. How did you pick the people that create this authentic and believable world?</strong><br><br>

			<p>I am always in a constant process of being proven wrong (laughs). I always thought it would be impossible to cast this play. I was so sure that there was no way we would find actors who would have the fluencies that are required, language-wise. Then there was gender, sexuality and age. Every little detail mattered–from what kind of an accent you have and if you can speak as though you have been through a Bangla medium schooling experience. It took a year and a half, the casting. But finally, we have an incredible group of people who are all making their off-Broadway debut. Half of the cast is of West-Bengali origin, the other half is of Bangladeshi origin. I was super involved throughout. Our casting directors, Stephanie Yankwitt and Kim Montelibano Heil, put their faith in our ability to find these people. The resources they provided, to fly people from everywhere, have allowed us to make this happen. A lot of the cast work other jobs, which they have left behind for four months to make their off-Broadway debut alongside me. It was a long slog, but I could not be more thrilled with the people we have on board. They are the crown jewel of the play.</p><br>

			<strong>Would you say the play is autobiographical?</strong><br><br>

			<p>The fact that so much of the play draws from a personal space allowed me to write it in so much detail, with a lot of nuances.</p><br><br>

			<strong>Which place in India do you have the strongest musical memory attached to?</strong><br><br>

			<p>In India, our old house in Delhi—the home we had when I was a child. I started playing there and I had hundreds of daily lessons there. Over the years, I grew up listening to music and meeting great musical legends at our home. My parents even hosted some concerts in the garden when I was a child. So it feels very evocative of music.</p><br>

			<strong>How did you pick the people that create this authentic and believable world?</strong><br><br>

			<p>I am always in a constant process of being proven wrong (laughs). I always thought it would be impossible to cast this play. I was so sure that there was no way we would find actors who would have the fluencies that are required, language-wise. Then there was gender, sexuality and age.

The resources they provided, to fly people from everywhere, have allowed us to make this happen.</p><br>

			<strong>What always makes you feel at home when you’re travelling?</strong><br><br>

			<p>I'm a real fan of creature comforts. I've been known to even travel with a favourite mug when I'm travelling for a long time. There's something comfortable but also soothing and ritualistic about something like having a warm beautiful mug to cut my hands around in the morning or in the evening. To connect with myself, I travel with a journal. Maybe sometimes, a favourite shawl that I may drape in a hotel room.</p><br>

			<strong>How did you come up with the name Public Obscenities?</strong><br><br>

			<p>There is a poem that I wrote a long time back, in Kolkata, with the same title. I was there for about a year. During my stay, I would spend a lot of time at Rabindra Sarobar, by the lake. This was before the era of dating apps, and the place was a popular queer cruising spot. I quickly realised that were a lot of queer people who existed in Kolkata.</p><br>

			<strong>Is there something in particular that you want people to take away from Public Obscenities?</strong><br><br>

			<p>There isn’t one thing that I want a coherent, homogenous audience to take away from this play. What I love about a production like this is that it can’t be reduced to a thesis statement. What I do want, is for the audience to feel transported into a universe that has been rendered so vividly that they can smell, hear, taste and experience some parts of my world. In many ways, I feel like the play is a grand invitation to travel to a corner of the world that feels important to me. <br><br>
