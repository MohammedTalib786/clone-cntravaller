			<p>On a cold winter’s night in the city of El Alto, Bolivia, we arrived at a mystical place where a dozen tiny rooms stood side by side. The cholitas (local Andean women in traditional bowler hats and voluminous skirts) performed rituals by the fires outside, burning offerings of incense, sugar figurines, shreds of wool and juniper leaves to the earth-goddess Pachamama. 
			</p><br>
			
			<!-- <strong>Why did you decide to make the play a bilingual production? Was it always the idea?</strong><br><br> -->

			<p>A Yatiri ushered me into her over-stuffed chamber. Besides the figurines of Christian saints, burning candles, a llama piñata, plastic flowers, chopped wood bundles and colourful textiles on the walls, there were eight rather ghoulish ñatitas, (human skulls)) in glass cases. Some of them were decorated with beads and flowers. One had sunglasses and a cigarette between the teeth. And there were llama foetuses hanging from the ceiling, one of which, she suggested, would make a nice offering in a ceremony to Pachamama, but I thanked her and opted to have my fortune read by the splashes of alcohol on a cardboard wall and some dried coca leaves. Janette Simbron, who owns and runs Bolivia Milenaria, the company that planned my trip, had been the most enjoyable company and she readily translated the Yatiri’s words for me.</p>

			<strong>How did you come up with the name Public Obscenities?</strong><br><br><br>

			<p>In a homogenised continent that saw Spaniards and other Europeans take over nearly completely over the last five-hundred years, Bolivia stands out, as 55% of its people are indigenous and many still hold on to their ancient traditions. One of the extraordinary joys of travel is to be privy, even for a short spell, to ancient and intact rituals and in this case, an unnervingly accurate clairvoyant.</p><br>

			<p>El Alto sits above La Paz at 4,000 meters, so it tends to be colder there, while La Paz is in a bowl that bottoms at around 3,000 metres. The main difference is that 90% of the people of El Alto are Aymara-speaking descendants of pre-Colonial locals. </p><br>

			<!-- <strong>Speaking of the moshari, which I know is an integral part of the script, did you want to introduce these cultural signifiers to the regular American audience intentionally?</strong><br>--><br> 

			<p>The moshari is there because it can not but be there, just like the other objects and experiences. In some ways, Choton is constantly in a process of explaining and translating for Raheem and the non-Bangali audience enters the play through Raheem’s experience. An experience that is only possible when they travel halfway across the world and try to understand who they are. I think the Bangali and the non-Bangali audience will have two radically different experiences of the play. If we were to stage this play in Kolkata, there would be many aspects of Choton and Raheem’s relationship that would seem equally foreign and unfamiliar to those audience members. I don’t think anyone, other than perhaps you and I…and a handful of people would have all of the fluencies required to decode the play. That very friction between the fluencies is what excites me.</p><br>

			<strong>The casting–with trans activist Tashnuva Anan and Namesake’s Gargi Mukherjee–is exciting. How did you pick the people that create this authentic and believable world?</strong><br><br>

			<p>I am always in a constant process of being proven wrong (laughs). I always thought it would be impossible to cast this play. I was so sure that there was no way we would find actors who would have the fluencies that are required, language-wise. Then there was gender, sexuality and age. Every little detail mattered–from what kind of an accent you have and if you can speak as though you have been through a Bangla medium schooling experience. It took a year and a half, the casting. But finally, we have an incredible group of people who are all making their off-Broadway debut. Half of the cast is of West-Bengali origin, the other half is of Bangladeshi origin. I was super involved throughout. Our casting directors, Stephanie Yankwitt and Kim Montelibano Heil, put their faith in our ability to find these people. The resources they provided, to fly people from everywhere, have allowed us to make this happen. A lot of the cast work other jobs, which they have left behind for four months to make their off-Broadway debut alongside me. It was a long slog, but I could not be more thrilled with the people we have on board. They are the crown jewel of the play.</p><br>

			<strong>A skinny cholita…no! She has to be curvy. A plump cholita means she’s wealthy.</strong><br><br>

			<p>“Ever since Evo Morales (an indigenous native) became president of Bolivia in 2005, they have come into their own,” explained Janette.</p><br><br>

			<strong>Which place in India do you have the strongest musical memory attached to?</strong><br><br>

			<p>The clean-shaven, short-haired men mostly wore western-style trousers and jackets, but some of them donned ponchos and the traditional chulu wool hats that cover the ears. I remarked on the curvy-appearance of the women, and Janet said, “A skinny cholita…no! She has to be curvy. A plump cholita means she’s wealthy.” I could tell they were strong by the loads they carried effortlessly even as they powered uphill. These are no shrinking violets. Cholita wrestling (called Cholitas luca libre) is a popular spectator sport in El Alto, where they wrestle and toss each other in a ring with their audience clapping and shouting for more.</p><br>

			<!-- <strong>How did you pick the people that create this authentic and believable world?</strong><br><br> -->

			<p>Just below, La Paz is a hastily-planned array of sloping streets that rise and fall with plenty of steps to navigate. Janet and I enjoyed lunch at the atmospheric Manq’a Restaurante and explored the colonial-era buildings downtown. While Janette is a descendant of Spanish ancestors, she too makes an offering to Pachamama on 1 August. She took me to the Witches’ Market, where the shops displayed, upfront, foetuses of llamas, chinchillas and vicuñyas. While they seemed creepy to me and reminded me of a failed life, for the locals they were just another object for offerings. The isles were replete with amulets, tinsel, herbs, oils and potions—all used for a multitude of things such as love, romance, marriage, good health, good luck and to find one’s angel. There were also potions for bringing evil upon others and wreaking havoc in their lives. Janet pointed to a potion especially meant for one’s arch-enemy. </p><br>

			<strong>What always makes you feel at home when you’re travelling?</strong><br><br>

			<p>I'm a real fan of creature comforts. I've been known to even travel with a favourite mug when I'm travelling for a long time. There's something comfortable but also soothing and ritualistic about something like having a warm beautiful mug to cut my hands around in the morning or in the evening. To connect with myself, I travel with a journal. Maybe sometimes, a favourite shawl that I may drape in a hotel room.</p><br>

			<!-- <strong>How did you come up with the name Public Obscenities?</strong><br><br> -->

			<p>The following day, we took the cable cars back up to El Alto. In some of the more up-market areas, local Aymara architect Freddie Mamani has designed many unique and ebullient buildings with multi-coloured façades with strong lines and symbols. They hark from the (pre-Inca) Tiwanakan empire that was settled not far from here, and whose ruins can be visited. We explored some of these large, strikingly flamboyant palaces that typically have a basement, a commercial ground floor (which might be an event room or some shops), apartments over the next couple of floors and a chalet-type house on the top. This is where the owners live. These buildings are called Cholets, an amalgam of the words ‘chalet’ and ‘cholo’. These neo-Andean mansions are symbols of local affluence and pride in the vernacular idiom. The wealthy set also announce themselves by holding elaborate fiestas when celebrating their landmark events. I was fortunate to witness one such bash, with men in swish, well-cut grey suits and bejewelled ladies in stylish versions of their traditional skirts and shawls. It might have been a party straight out of  The Great Gatsby. A live band played on stage, and there were over 400 guests, all drinking, chatting and swaying to the music. <br><br>
